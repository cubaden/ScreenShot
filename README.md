# ScreenShot

This is a speed test, and you can copy code from anywhere you want, use any API you want, just do it fast - in 60 minutes.


Tasks:

Part 1 - write a program, no UI, that takes a screenshot and writes it to .bmp.

Part 2 - modify the program. Take a screenshot, sleep 10 seconds, take another screenshot. Pixels that are NOT the same - make them green, and write the new bmp.
